# WEB102 Prework - Krackin

Submitted by: Valerie May Yen

Krackin is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total <em>(this is a guesstimate, i spaced it out over two days)</em>

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [✔] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [✔] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [✔] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [✔] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✔] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    * [✔] add visual cue of hovering for button for visually impaired users (border and color change)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

- So i just took CMSC330 at UMD which is organization of programming languages and we learned about HOFs.
  i can't lie, i got real scared the minute i saw the word "accumulator" in the reduce function explanation. i looked like this meme

- <em>HOWEVER,</em> after reading through it i realized i was just in my head and it honestly made a lot more sense in js than in ocaml (...that class was ROUGH)
- Additionally, i am self taught in js so there are some more nitty-gritty language-structual things i had to google to understand (like usages of const vs. var cus in my brain i was thinking of it like java and c)

if you are interested in seeing how i tracked my work, i wrote EVERYTHING in this doc:
